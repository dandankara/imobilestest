                    Sometimes itâ€™s hard enough just sharing a restaurant bill. Try sharing that
                    bill week in, week out and you might encounter more than a few snares. But not
                    with Hapu. Simply set your rates and our automated payment system takes care of the rest.
                    You need never talk money or who owes what.
                </p>
